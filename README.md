# PythonESN
This is an implementation of Echo State Networks (ESN) for Python with
parameter tuning via evolutionary algorithms. The implementation
supports dimensionality reduction between the reservoir and the readout
layer as described in [1].

Currently, the dimensionality reduction layer could either be *identity*
(no dimensionality reduction), *pca* (Principal Component Analysis) or
*kpca* (Kernel PCA). The readout layer supports the following
algorithms:
* Linear regression
* Ridge regression
* Lasso
* Elastic net
* Linear and Kernel Support Vector Regression

## Dependencies
* [SCOOP] (https://github.com/soravux/scoop)
* [DEAP] (https://github.com/DEAP/deap)
* [Scikit Learn] (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [SciPy stack] (http://www.scipy.org/install.html)

## Usage
*run_experiments.sh* runs parameter optimization and computes errors,
means and standard deviations for all optimization config files in
*configs/user* for all data sets in *data*.

The config files in *configs/user* are overloading the default config
file in *configs/opt/default.json*. This means that for a given config
file, it uses all fields in *configs/opt/default.json* except the ones
specified in the user config file.

The parameters found by the optimization scheme are saved to an ESN
config file in */configs/esn*, which is used to initialize the
network for experiments. The results are saved in *results*.
